            <p>I was born on a beautiful thursday the 16th in October of 1997. Wow! Absolutely insane, that makes me a Libra if you like that sort of stuff. This also makes my birthstone opal! WOW! I was born with all my likes and dislikes pre-programed. I like the color red and love spicy foods!</p>

            <p>
                I became a Dungeon Master in 2016. That's 5 years ago (as of writing this). I mostly play Pathfinder and actually not Dungeons and Dragons, wow what a hipster. This is a picture of me being a wonderful dungeon master (wow look at all that gear)!
